        The earliest written record of noodles is found in a book dated to the
        Eastern Han period (25â€“220 CE). Noodles made from wheat dough became a
        prominent food for the people of the Han dynasty. The oldest evidence of
        noodles was from 4,000 years ago in China. In 2005, a team of
        archaeologists reported finding an earthenware bowl that contained
        4000-year-old noodles at the Lajia archaeological site. These noodles
        were said to resemble lamian, a type of Chinese noodle. Analyzing the
        husk phytoliths and starch grains present in the sediment associated
        with the noodles, they were identified as millet belonging to Panicum
        miliaceum and Setaria italica. However, other researchers cast doubt
        that Lajia's noodles were made from specifically millet: it is difficult
        to make pure millet noodles, it is unclear whether the analyzed residue
        were directly derived from Lajia's noodles themselves, starch morphology
        after cooking shows distinctive alterations that does not fit with
        Lajia's noodles, and it is uncertain whether the starch-like grains from
        Laijia's noodles are starch as they show some non-starch
        characteristics.Food historians generally estimate that pasta's origin
        is from among the Mediterranean countries:a homogenous mixture of flour
        and water called itrion as described by 2nd century Greek physician
        Galen, among 3rd to 5th century Palestinians as itrium as described by
        the Jerusalem Talmud and as itriyya (Arabic cognate of the Greek word),
        string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking as defined
        by the 9th century Aramean physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali.
